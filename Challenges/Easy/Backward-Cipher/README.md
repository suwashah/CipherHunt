## Details:

- difficulty: Easy
- category: Cryptography
- domain: -
- author: Subash
- flags: flag{cryptography}

## Description:

A message has been encrypted using a backwards cipher. Your task is to decrypt the given message to reveal the flag.

## Hint:

Read the message backwards to reveal the original text.

## Intended Learning and outcome:

- Particpants will be able learn about different types of ciphers, such as the Caesar cipher and reverse cipher.
- Participants will be able to enhance their logical thinking and pattern recognition skills
- They will be prepared for more advanced cryptographic studies or challenges

## Deployment:

Players should get the information.txt file to find the flag

## Solution:

To solve this challenge, participants need to:

- Open the information.txt file
- Reverse the whole sentences using any string reversal tool and look for the flag
