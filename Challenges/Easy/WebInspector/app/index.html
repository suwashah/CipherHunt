        Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the standard markup language for
        documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It defines the
        content and structure of web content. It is often assisted by
        technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting
        languages such as JavaScript. Web browsers receive HTML documents from a
        web server or from local storage and render the documents into
        multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page
        semantically and originally included cues for its appearance. HTML
        elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs,
        images and other objects such as interactive forms may be embedded into
        the rendered page. HTML provides a means to create structured documents
        by denoting structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs,
        lists, links, quotes, and other items. HTML elements are delineated by
        tags, written using angle brackets. HTML can embed programs written in a
        scripting language such as JavaScript, which affects the behavior and
        content of web pages. The inclusion of CSS defines the look and layout
        of content. The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), former maintainer of
        the HTML and current maintainer of the CSS standards, has encouraged the
        use of CSS over explicit presentational HTML since 1997.[2] A form of
        HTML, known as HTML5, is used to display video and audio, primarily
        using the &lt;canvas&gt; element, together with JavaScript.
