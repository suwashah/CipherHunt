## Title: Basic Caesar Cipher

## Details:

- difficulty: Easy
- category: Cryptography
- domain: -
- author: Subash
- flags: flag{message_receiver}

## Description:

In this challenge, you will decrypt a message that has been encoded using a Caesar cipher, one of the simplest and most well-known encryption techniques in history. Named after Julius Caesar, who is said to have used it to secure his military communications, the Caesar cipher works by shifting each letter of the alphabet by a fixed number of positions.

## Hint:

To decrypt the message, you need to reverse the shift. This means shifting each letter in the encrypted message back by fixed number of position.

## Intended Learning and outcome:

- Particpants will be able gain the foundational understanding of the Caesar cipher, a classic encryption technique.
- Participants will learn how the Caesar cipher works, including the concept of shifting letters in the alphabet by a fixed number of positions.
- They will be prepared for more advanced cryptographic studies or challenges

## Deployment:

Players should get the Caesar-info.txt file to find the flag

## Solution:

To solve this challenge, participants need to:

- Open the Caesar-info.txt file
- Reverse the Caesar cipher by shifting each letter in the encrypted message back by 4 position. The resulting plaintext reveals the flag: flag{message_receiver}.
