# CipherHunt

The `Cipher Hunt` project is a Capture The Flag (CTF) challenge platform designed to provide hands-on cybersecurity experience to students, developers, and engineers. 
- Users register as participants, log in, and tackle challenges in categories like forensics, web, Linux, pwn, and reverse engineering, requiring technical skills to find and submit challenge flags.
- Participants will also exploit cybersecurity flaws and vulnerabilities within the challenges to retrieve the flags. The platform supports multiple participants, with scoring based on performance, and the highest scorer declared the winner.
- It targets universities offering cybersecurity courses and IT companies, with future plans to introduce logical thinking games for school students to foster basic cybersecurity knowledge.
